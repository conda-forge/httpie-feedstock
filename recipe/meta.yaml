  summary: a CLI, cURL-like tool for humans
  description: |
    HTTPie (pronounced aitch-tee-tee-pie) is a command line HTTP client. Its
    goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as
    possible. It provides a simple http command that allows for sending
    arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax, and displays
    colorized output. HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging, and generally
    interacting with HTTP servers.
